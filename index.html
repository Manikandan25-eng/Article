            <h3 class ="mainheading">Elementary Education</h3>
            <p>Elementary education marks the beginning of a child's formal education journey. Typically starting at age 6, this stage focuses on basic academic learning and socialization skills. The curriculum includes fundamental subjects such as reading, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies. In addition to academic learning, elementary education places a strong emphasis on developing essential life skills such as communication, cooperation, and problem-solving. Teachers play a pivotal role in nurturing a child's curiosity and love for learning, setting the foundation for future educational pursuits.

            <h3 class ="mainheading">Secondary Education</h3>
            <p>Secondary education, often referred to as middle school and high school, builds upon the foundation laid during the elementary years. This stage typically spans ages 11 to 18 and is divided into two parts: lower secondary (middle school) and upper secondary (high school). The curriculum becomes more specialized, offering a wider range of subjects, including advanced mathematics, literature, history, sciences, and foreign languages. Students are encouraged to explore their interests and talents through elective courses and extracurricular activities. Secondary education also introduces students to critical thinking, analytical skills, and the ability to work independently, preparing them for higher educational opportunities and the demands of the modern world.

        <h3  class ="mainheading">Higher Secondary Education</h3>
    

        <p>
            Higher secondary education, commonly known as senior secondary or pre-university education, is the final stage of school education before college. It typically includes grades 11 and 12, catering to students aged 16 to 18. During this stage, students choose a specific stream or field of study, such as science, commerce, or humanities, based on their interests and career aspirations. The curriculum is more focused and rigorous, aimed at providing in-depth knowledge and preparing students for college-level education. Higher secondary education also involves standardized examinations that play a crucial role in college admissions. This stage is critical for students as it shapes their academic and professional futures, requiring dedication, hard work, and effective time management.

            <p>
                College education, also known as tertiary or higher education, represents the pinnacle of the formal education system. This stage typically begins around age 18 and includes undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs. College education offers a wide array of disciplines and specializations, allowing students to pursue their chosen fields in depth. The learning environment in college is characterized by greater autonomy, research opportunities, and practical applications of knowledge. Students engage in lectures, seminars, laboratory work, internships, and research projects, developing advanced skills and expertise. College education not only equips students with professional qualifications but also fosters critical thinking, creativity, and leadership abilities. It serves as a gateway to career opportunities, personal growth, and lifelong learning.
